        <p>Hi, I'm Kate, or Salixa in various places on the internet. I am currently doing a Software Engineering Apprenticeship with Multiverse
            while working at the Norfolk County Council.
        </p>
        <p>I have a degree in Computer Science from Aberystwyth University but I graduated before JavaScript was cool so here I am, 
            learning web code from scratch.</p>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoy the design and UI aspects of web development but am excited to learn more about backend development and deployment.</p>
